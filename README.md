# PLAYT Client

An API client for PLAYT, written in Typescript.

## Features

- Support authentication
- Full support for all endpoints
- Fully typed request and response objects

## Usage

```sh
npm install @playt/client
```

### API Client

When you want to connect an application to our API you must generate an API Key first.

You can then use the client as follows:

```js
import PlaytApiClient from '@playt/client';

// Create a new client with API Key and optional API URL
const apiClient = PlaytApiClient({
  apiUrl: '<API_URL>',
  apiKey: '<API_KEY>',
});
```

### Browser Client

For a web-based game, you also need to load the browser client in the browser when the user is playing the game. Among other optional features, it tracks user inputs for cheat detection using [Anybrain](https://anybrain.gg/). Use the browser client as follows:

```js
import PlaytBrowserClient from '@playt/client/browser';

const browserClient = PlaytBrowserClient({
  apiUrl: '<API_URL>',
})

// When the game starts
await browserClient.startMatch('<USER_ID>', '<MATCH_ID>', '<PLAYER_TOKEN>');

// When the game ends
await browserClient.stopMatch();
```

## API

The API is documented on [Swagger](https://fun-fair.vercel.app/devs/docs) and [OpenAPI](https://fun-fair.vercel.app/api/docs). The client is generated from the OpenAPI specification and is fully typed.

Example

```ts
// Submits a score
const { ok, data, status, statusMessage } = await client.submitScore({
  playerToken: 'PLAYER_TOKEN',
  score: 1000,
  finalSnapshot: true,
});
```

## Development

The API types in this repository are generated based on our [OpenAPI](https://fun-fair.vercel.app/api/docs) and its corresponding types in `playt-net/fun-fair`. If the fun-fair OpenAPI changes, this project needs to be updated as well. You can do this with a few simple steps:

1. Generate new types

```sh
npm run generate
```

This will access all OpenAPI endpoints and generate changes based on changes to the API.

2. Check if `src/index.ts` needs to be adjusted. In case of bigger changes, for example changes to the method of an endpoint or a new endpoint, you need to update the corresponding methods.

   > ‚òù You may need to update `test/fetch.test.ts` if there are significant changes to `src/index.ts`

3. Commit changes and open a PR on GitHub
4. Once changes have been approved and merged it might be time for a release
5. Create a release by running `npm version` with the correct argument to bump the repsitory's version
6. Push tags, generated by the previous command

```sh
git push --tags
```

7. Create a release on GitHub
