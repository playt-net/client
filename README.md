# PLAYT Client

An API client for PLAYT, written in Typescript.

## Features

- Support authentication
- Full support for all endpoints
- Fully typed request and response objects

## Usage

```sh
npm install @playt/client
```

## API Key Usage

When you want to connect an application to our API you must generate an API Key first.

You can then use the client as follows:

```ts
import PlaytClient from '@playt/client';

// Create a new client with API Key and optional API URL
const client = PlaytClient('<API_KEY>', '<API_URL>');
```

## API

The API is documented on [Swagger](https://fun-fair.vercel.app/devs/docs) and [OpenAPI](https://fun-fair.vercel.app/api/docs). The client is generated from the OpenAPI specification and is fully typed.

Example

```ts
// Submits a score
const { ok, data, status, statusMessage } = await client.submitScore({
  playerToken: 'PLAYER_TOKEN',
  score: 1000,
  finalSnapshot: true,
});
```

## Development

The API types in this repository are generated based on our [OpenAPI](https://fun-fair.vercel.app/api/docs) and its corresponding types in `playt-net/fun-fair`. If the fun-fair OpenAPI changes, this project needs to be updated as well. You can do this with a few simple steps:

1. Generate new types

```sh
npm run generate
```

This will access all OpenAPI endpoints and generate changes based on changes to the API.

2. Check if `src/index.ts` needs to be adjusted. In case of bigger changes, for example changes to the method of an endpoint or a new endpoint, you need to update the corresponding methods.

   > ‚òù You may need to update `test/fetch.test.ts` if there are significant changes to `src/index.ts`

3. Commit changes and open a PR on GitHub
4. Once changes have been approved and merged it might be time for a release
5. Create a release by running `npm version` with the correct argument to bump the repsitory's version
6. Push tags, generated by the previous command

```sh
git push --tags
```

7. Create a release on GitHub
